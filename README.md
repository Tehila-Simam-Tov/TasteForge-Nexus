```
┌─────────────┐        REST API        ┌──────────────┐
│  Angular    │  <----------------->  │  Node.js     │
│  Frontend   │                      │  Express.js  │
└─────────────┘                       │  Backend     │
				│                             └──────┬───────┘
				│                                    │
				▼                                    ▼
	 Responsive UI                        MongoDB
	 (Bootstrap, MUI, CSS)                Database

## Project Structure
- **Frontend (`myproject/src/app`):**
	- `components/`: Home, Login, Register, Add Recipe, Recipe Details, Navigation, etc.
	- `services/`: API communication for recipes and users
	- `interface/`: Type definitions for recipes and users
- **Backend (`project/`):**
	- `controlers/`: Business logic for recipes and users
	- `models/`: MongoDB schemas
	- `routes/`: API endpoints
	- `middlewares/`: Authorization, authentication, and validation
	- `validators/`: Input validation logic

---

## Security & Best Practices
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, with secure password hashing
- **Authorization:** Role-based access for sensitive operations
- **Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error responses and logging
- **Code Quality:** Modular, maintainable, and well-documented codebase
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data managed via `.env` files

---

## Testing
- **Unit Testing:**
	- Angular: Jasmine & Karma for frontend components and services
	- Node.js: Mocha/Chai or Jest for backend logic
- **End-to-End Testing:**
	- Cypress or Protractor for full user flows
- **Manual QA:**
	- UI/UX, accessibility, and security testing
